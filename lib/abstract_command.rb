# Shell Command Abstraction.
#
# Hides away all the details to generate a command.
# And provides an easy interface to interact with shell commands as if
# they were objects.
#
# This is good for the following reasons:
#
# - Enforces standardization.
# - Enforces separation of command definition and consumption.
# - Enforces configuration over code.
# - Enforces configuration over refactoring.
# - Enforces simple shell-command definition.
# - Enforces automatic sanitization of variables that get interpolated.
# - Provides a simple Object Oriented Interface.
# - Provides a scope for variables that belong to the command.
# - Provides getters and setter for every interpolation in command.
# - Provides a neat interface that plugs to data structures transparently.
# - Avoids methods with many arguments.
# - Avoids changes in the standared libarary: system, backtick, etc.
